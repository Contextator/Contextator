# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and version numbers follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Before `1.0.0`, a minor version may change a public contract** — the HTTP and MCP APIs, the MCP
tool names and their parameters, environment variable names — without a major bump. Once `1.0.0`
ships, that stops.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A source's **Language** setting is back on the dashboard, and `turkish` is one of the values it
  offers. Naming a source's language makes PostgreSQL stem it, so a Turkish question asking about
  `anahtarı` now finds a page that says `anahtarın`. Changing the setting re-indexes that source, as
  changing its content type already did.

### Changed

- **Keyword search now speaks every language in a project at once.** It used to parse every question
  in one configuration chosen for the whole instance, which meant a source that named a language was
  indexed one way and asked another, and contributed nothing to the keyword half at all. Each source
  is now read in its own configuration and one search reaches all of them. A project that names no
  language on any source is unaffected, down to the ordering of its results.

### Fixed

- **The same search over the same documentation returns the same page again.** Between two results
  that scored identically, which one came first was decided by an internal identifier that is minted
  fresh every time a project is re-indexed — so a project holding two languages could hand back a
  different fifth result after a rebuild, with nothing having changed but the rebuild. Equal results
  are now ordered by the documents themselves: the shorter excerpt first, then the document's own
  path and the position of the passage within it.
- Documentation said PostgreSQL has no Turkish configuration. It has one, and Turkish sources were
  being indexed without stemming because of that claim.

### Upgrading

- No action, and nothing is re-indexed. The first start after upgrading rewrites the keyword index of
  any source that names a language, in batches, from text already in the database — no re-embedding
  and no rebuild. Searches keep working while it runs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-19

First published release. `0.1.0` describes what the product does, not what changed to get there.

### Added

- A self-hosted, multi-tenant MCP documentation server: give a project its document sources and it
  becomes its own `/mcp/<project-name>` endpoint that AI agents can search.
- Source types: local directories, git repositories, uploaded files and archives (`.zip`, `.tar`,
  `.tar.gz`, `.rar`), Notion workspaces and Confluence Cloud sites.
- Document conversion to Markdown for `.html`, `.docx`, `.csv` and `.pdf` files, so an agent reads
  them the way it reads a page of documentation.
- An OpenAPI/Swagger content type: a specification is indexed as one document per operation, not
  as a single file, so a hit is the endpoint rather than the whole spec.
- Hybrid search: vector similarity and keyword search fused with reciprocal rank fusion, over
  chunks that carry a heading breadcrumb.
- Local embeddings on the CPU by default (`multilingual-e5-small`, covering 100 languages), with
  `EMBEDDING_DTYPE` to trade model size against precision (fp32/fp16/q8), or OpenAI embeddings as
  an alternative. Search within a language is strong; cross-language search is a known limit and
  is documented as one in the README rather than fixed.
- An admin dashboard and REST API to manage projects, sources and members — the normal way to add
  a source and trigger a re-index.
- MCP access on one URL per project, both transports: Streamable HTTP and legacy HTTP+SSE. Tools:
  `search_docs`, `list_topics`, `read_document`.
- Three settings for an MCP endpoint: open, a static bearer token, or account-backed access through
  OAuth 2.1 — the last so browser-based connectors can sign in.
- Accounts, roles and per-project memberships, with `ADMIN_TOKEN` for scripts and CI.
- An audit log and a per-query log of what agents asked and what they were told.
- Incremental indexing: files are hashed, only changed files are re-embedded, removed files are
  deleted from the index.
- One Docker image, `contextator/contextator`, for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, holding both
  PostgreSQL and the app. The schema updates itself on startup, and `npm run reset-password` ships
  inside the image as a last-resort recovery tool.
